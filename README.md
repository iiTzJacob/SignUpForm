# SignUpForm
By Jacob Colon

This project is a frontend only signup form that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is designed to collect user information such as name, email, and password, and provide visual feedback for invalid entries. No backend functionality is included, therefore user data is not stored or processed. This project demonstrates skills in creating a visually appealing and responsive form, as well as form validation using JavaScript.
